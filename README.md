## About the Project

During my Master's research project, we wished to model electric field pulses that could be applied to a semiconducting 2D material via a conducting STM tip . Previous work [1][2] has shown that pulsing of this kind can change the magnetic domain structure of the material, leading the way for possible all-electrical manipulation of magnetic domains. This code plots data generated using COMSOL Multiphysics to show how the electric field intensity varies across the surface of the material
